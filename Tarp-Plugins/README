Tarp-Plugins

This module has plugins for the various Toolkit apps and modules, bundled
together and with some hopefully useful tests.  Somewhere down the road it
should grow to be more comprehensive and maybe even branch off into more than
one set of plugins to accomodate different types of source data.
