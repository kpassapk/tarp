LaTeXtract didn't like a tag in in/in.tex.
Succesful matches prior to tag error: 
(1) beginTag[0] {} at in/in.tex line 3
(2) itemTag[2][0] { ITM => "a" } at in/in.tex line 4
(3) itemTag[2][0] { ITM => "i" } at in/in.tex line 6
ERROR: Missing tag between 01a and 01i (maybe due to a missing beginTag?), stopped at in/in.tex line 4
