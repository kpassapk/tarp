0.921	July 29, 2009
	Changed solutions-starter.tas

0.92    July 28, 2009
        Removed exString_inl which I had put in 0.91.  Changed GenPK::Style and
        GenPK to work without.  Also, varsIn now only returns dollar sign
        variables and not the (?<foo>) ones.  Changed Spec::simple() to pattern
        match for variables instead.
        

0.91	July 27, 2009
	- itemTag[0] has to be provided by user now. 
	- Putting <illegal> in any .tas subscripted ([n]) entry causes
  	program to fall back to parent entry and print an error if the tag matches.
	This is the new mechanism for outlawing tag matches at a certain item stack level.
	- Style::EX has a few changes: exString now has three values and produces a proper stack
	without trailing undefines when matching.  The old one is in exString_inl.  Some old
	methods such as tex2split and split2tex have been removed.  There is a new .tas entry called
	exSplit, however, equivalent to the old texSplit.  This can be used for convenience for converting
	an exercise stack to a texSplit.
	- Modified all .tas files in the distribution with itemTag[0] = <illegal>-$ITM$.
